1) There are three different types of iterations and each have their own different working as 'for' loop is best when the number of iterations to be done is know in while loop are flexible and helpful while using flag variables as we have used in our code (continue_loop and note) and the do while ensures that the loop is executed atleast once.Typically working with arrays we use 'For' loops provide easy readibility and understandable for others. 'For' loops are best as they provide direct access to the indexes of the arrays as in this code we had to print the values stored in the arrays in the bill summary and also in the calculation so the for loop was used to specify the index in the array from where they value was to be used. Overall from all the other iteration types for provides more organised and clea method for the same problem and it also is useful when direct access to the array index is requied.

2) For testing and debuging my programm at first I didn't just write all the code at once but after completing one part of the code I tested it and then went to the next part (like for eg. in this code when the priority part was completed I didnt straight away started the next one but first debugged that code and tested it a few time with the given sample values and also by inputing random values to check if it worked correctly with every value and not just the given sample values ). To locate the syntatic error I relied upon the error messages and also kept an eye if any semicolon or was missing or any variable name was misspelled. Semantic errors are harder to identify than the syntatic ones I carefully examined to look out for irregular logic which could result in unexpected values running the programm several times to check if the iterations are working correcty and also using IDE tools to break the code in between to check the values.

3) In this error the input should've been 0 but user inputed 567.89, also to sucsefully identify it the file output.txt and error.txt are helpful as they exactly tell at which line the value or the output is incorrect carefully examining the logic and the calculations done in that part using IDE to set a breakpoint before that line to see if the logic used is correct or not.
