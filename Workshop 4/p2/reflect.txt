1) I made my logic more organized and maintained by using proper indentations wherever they were necessary to show the proper structure of the code. I also kept the names of variables self-explanatory as there are no problems in knowing which variable is meant for what. I also added some comments in my code to show what is happening in that particular loop and avoided using very complex and deep nesting to avoid confusion.


2)If nested logic wasn't possible then the final code would've been different from now as without nesting the length of the code would be increased considerably making it more repetitive complex and confusing. All in all the code would be with less organisation and clarity.

3) In an 'if' optional path construct every single condition is processed even if the previous condition would be true so if a user puts an input out of the range the 'if' function would still run that input through all the conditions but on the other hand in the 'if/else if' the range of what is to be carried out in what condition is preset and potential errors and unexpected outputs are prevented. Also the 'if' condition results in reduced organization making the code more complex.
