1) We try to use variables and macros to represent information rather than hard coding them because this method is less prone to errors and also keeps the code easy to read and organised. Defining a macro also allows the value to be declared constant throughout the code taking the workshop for an example we needed to keep the value of maximum and minimum year constant and rather than hard coding it, declaring a macro was easier as it allowed the code to be less prone to errors, the self-defining names of macros also increased the readability of the code and lastly it also made it easier for future changes as if the value needed to be changed then instead of finding every single hard coded value in the programm only the macros could be changed.

2) The sums and avgerage part of the workshop was a simple and straightforward one as it only required simple calculations using arthematic expressions including this operation inside any validation routine would introduce unneccessary complexity and will make the code disorganised and harder to understand. This is also a better desing because according to the workshop we dont need any kind of additional validations for the sum average calculation parts as we did in the others so there is basically no need to include them in any validationn process. So ultimately this is a better design because it is more organised, more flexible to changes and less complex.
